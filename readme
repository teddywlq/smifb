1. Introduction
SiliconMotion SM750/SM768 Graphics PCI-E DRM Driver

2. Usage
This driver can be compiled under the kernel 4.x. 
1)  Please make sure that you are in console and run as root user.
2)  Open this driver directory, and use the "make" command, it will to generate the "smifb.ko".
3)	Install the module.
	make install
4)  use "depmod -a" to handle dependency descriptions for loadable kernel modules.
5)	Reboot and restart graphic interface, 

3. Some notes and driver parameters:

	Module loading paremeter:

	1)."bpp"
	If you use SM768 as primary card, you can directly use it. The driver will set color depth to 16bpp by default. 
	If you want to change it,please directly add module paremeter, "insmod ./smifb.ko bpp=32"
	
	2). "nopnp" 
	The specific output will be recognized as connected. If edid cannot be read, the resolution will be ¡°1024x768¡± by default.
	 bit0:DVI,bit1:VGA,bit2:HDMI 
	 For example, if you want to use VGA single to connected
	Use ¡°insmod ./smifb.ko nopnp=1¡±

		Notes:If you build the driver with built-in method, the paramter
		you edited in the grub config file will be also the
		same format as above modular method,but additionaly add
		"smifb.bpp=32" or "smifb.nopnp=1"
		
	Build paremeter:

	1). If you use SM768 as secondary  card and let it work with onboard graphic driver to do extend display. Please compile the driver with "make prime=1". 
	In this situation, color depth will be set to 32bpp.
	2). If you want to use analog/HDMI audio on SM768, please compile the driver with "make audio=1"
