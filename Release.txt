Note:
1.If you use SM768 as primary card, you can directly use it. The driver will 
set color depth to 16bpp by default. If you want to change it, please add in 
kernel parameter "bpp = 32"

2.If you use SM768 as secondary  card and let it work with onboard graphic 
driver to do extend display. Please compile the driver with "make prime=1". 
In this situation, color depth will be set to 32bpp.

3. If we plug-in three monitor(CRT,DVI,HDMI) simultaneously, the output will 
be only DVI+CRT

4. Screen may have some very quick garbage(<1s) in mode setting. All driver 
have this issue. If you can duplicate the garbage in AMD card. Please set it 
to OS issue.


Known issue:
1.It maybe screen garbage in monitor resume from suspend stauts, the 
garbage will appear in less then half second then it will disappear. 

2.For monitor PNP, please do it slowly. For example, Set HDMI and DVI to 
dual, Plug out DVI. please wait and let it turn to HDMI only. then plug in CRT.

Support OS/kernel/arch:
1.support OS :Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS
2.support kernel version: 4.8
3.support arch: x86 and x86_64

Known issue:
1. As SM768 shuttle2 ASIC has HW PCI class issue(Non-VGA Class), we have some 
limitations:
	a.  We can only  use SM768 as primary card in limited motherboards. 
		But it’s not suitable for all the motherboard. 
		So we suggest to set SM768 as secondary card for testing.
	b. If you want to use it as secondary card in system. Please follow the steps below:
		For using of motherboard include Intel’s GPU chip:
		Please DO NOT occupy i915.ko etc. You can delete i915.ko and rebuild the 
		ramfs(ie:mkinitramfs /boot/initrd.img-4.8.0-58-generic).
	c. Please use the xorg.conf file in driver for testing in case for SM768
	d. Because this not a common case for the driver loading, sometimes the 
		system will dead after start X(Intel driver also has this issue).Please 
		delete the xorg.conf file and let the X start. Then stop the X and add the 
		xorg.conf file. Finally, restart the X agian.

2. For monitor PNP, please plug-in the new monitor after the old monitor 
plug-out status changed.(bug 1807).It¡¯s HW limitation (SW I2C Read slow)on shuttle2.We will fix it when we received MP chip.

3. The desktop depth set to 16bpp default. Please use 16bpp for testing. If you 
still want to use 32bpp, please modify the macro DRVBPP in smi_drv.h file to 24 

4. After reboot, can't enter the OS (Random 1/20). May kernel crushed. It may caused by kernel version.

5.	It maybe screen garbage in monitor PnP/Mode setting/login/logout ,then the garbage will disappear. 
It’s OS limitations and DRM arch issue. The new ATOMIC Arch driver will be resolve these issue. 
We will implement atomic feature later.(bug 1813,1817,1818,1819,1821,1822,1823,1820)

6. VGA port only: Sometimes, for some monitor(eg ViewSonic 22') edid cannot be read by using DDK counter loop wait.
It caused by unstable shuttle2 HW I2C. As MP chip GPIO SW I2C will be redefined and HW I2C will be stable. 
The code is ready and we will modify it later.

7. Using new modesetting could solve these problems below(We provided binary of x64 as a sample):
	1) Improve tearing issue.
	2) Fix bug of 2-mice.
The new version will be included in newer version of Ubuntu. So we just suggest(but not force) users to use newer modesetting.	
Dowload path: svn://172.17.9.90/Falcon/Software/RemoteDisplay/Linux/Drivers/XServer/Sources/Trunk/modesetting
svn revision: 46021

8. Please DO NOT test rotation function. Xorg Modesetting driver rotation function has bugs. (eg: Can't rotate in DualView)

Note:
1. If we plug-in three monitor(CRT,DVI,HDMI) simultaneously, the output will be 
only DVI+CRT
2. If the system doesn't do the monitor PnP, plesae press the Detect Display 
button on the Display control panel.
3. Please use DVI-VGA converter to test DVI monitor. We didn’t add SIL164 DVI transmitter code into the driver.
